This is the first real project I created. It uses Microsoft's Translator API to translate your voice. The program records audio from the mic and then sends it via a bitstream to Microsoft's server. This returns a JSON object with the english recognition, and the translation. Currently programmed to output Spanish, but there are many languages supported. 

NOTE: Apparently this is an old API, I have not replaced it with the newer version from Microsoft, I have not tried running it recently, as this project was completed about two years ago.
